# RSVPlease

This project is an experiment to check, if you can manage participants for events on the nostr protocol.

## Installation

Just run `yarn` or `npm install` and afterwards `yarn dev`or `npm run dev` and you are good to go. As this application uses the nostr protocol, any url that works in development will also work in production.

## Feature ideas

- add reactions to messages
- configure relays and allow private relays to enable more privacy
- enable end date, description
